# Hellish Maze Video Game 🔥 ![Status badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/finished-red)

Hellish Maze is a video game that consists of finding the shortest path to reach the farthest treasure.

This Game allows users to choose an avatar which will be the one that will be known from his arrival until his completion, apart from that, he will be able to choose the mode in which he wants to play, so that himself is the selector of his own destiny. After choosing a mode, the application will generate a world, with a number of random doors and rooms. Finally, it must also be able to show the best possible path to the treasure after finishing the game, either by losing or having won, this in order to show the users the decisions they should make.

This version was created by Alejandro Varela, Luis Murcia and Gabriel Suarez. The interesting about the work, is the application code use a varitie of java tools like collections ands data structures, but also the team create their owns structures for futures implementations using decoupling concept and use abstract factory as a creational pattern.
